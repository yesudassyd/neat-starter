          <li>Publishing such information on the Website.</li>
          <li>Contacting End-Users for offering new products or services.</li>
        </ol>

      hereby consent to such collection and use of such information by Prac360. However, Prac360 shall not contact You
      on Your telephone number(s) for any purpose including those mentioned in this sub-section 4.1(iii), if such
      telephone number is registered with the Do Not Call registry (&ldquo;DNC Registry&rdquo;) under the PDPA without
      your express, clear and un-ambiguous written consent.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1.4</strong>Collection, use and disclosure of information which has been designated as Personal
        Information or Sensitive Personal Data or Information&rsquo; under the SPI Rules requires your express consent.
        By affirming your assent to this Privacy Policy, you provide your consent to such use, collection and disclosure
        as required under applicable law.</li>
      <li><strong>1.5</strong>Prac360 does not control or endorse the content, messages or information found in any
        Services and, therefore, Prac360 specifically disclaims any liability with regard to the Services and any
        actions resulting from your participation in any Services, and you agree that you waive any claims against
        Prac360 relating to same, and to the extent such waiver may be ineffective, you agree to release any claims

        as your contact information provided as part of account registration. If your personal information changes, you
        may correct, delete inaccuracies, or amend information by making the change on our member information page or by
        contacting us through&nbsp;privacy@Prac360.com. We will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our
        then active databases as soon as reasonably practicable. If you provide any information that is untrue,
        inaccurate, out of date or incomplete (or becomes untrue, inaccurate, out of date or incomplete), or Prac360 has
        reasonable grounds to suspect that the information provided by you is untrue, inaccurate, out of date or
        incomplete, Prac360 may, at its sole discretion, discontinue the provision of the Services to you. There may be
        circumstances where Prac360 will not correct, delete or update your Personal Data, including (a) where the
        Personal Data is opinion data that is kept solely for evaluative purpose; and (b) the Personal Data is in
        documents related to a prosecution if all proceedings relating to the prosecution have not been completed.</li>

        information for longer than is required for the purposes for which the information may lawfully be used or is
        otherwise required under any other law for the time being in force. After a period of time, your data may be
        anonymized and aggregated, and then may be held by us as long as necessary for us to provide our Services
        effectively, but our use of the anonymized data will be solely for analytic purposes. Please note that your
        withdrawal of consent, or cancellation of account may result in Prac360 being unable to provide you with its
        Services or to terminate any existing relationship Prac360 may have with you.</li>
      <li><strong>1.8</strong>If you wish to opt-out of receiving non-essential communications such as promotional and
        marketing-related information regarding the Services, please send us an email at support@Prac360.com .</li>
      <li><strong>1.9</strong>Prac360 may require the User to pay with a credit card, wire transfer, debit card or
        cheque for Services for which subscription amount(s) is/are payable. Prac360 will collect such User&rsquo;s
        credit card number and/or other financial institution information such as bank account numbers and will use that
        information for the billing and payment processes, including but not limited to the use and disclosure of such
        credit card number and information to third parties as necessary to complete such billing operation.
        Verification of credit information, however, is accomplished solely by the User through the authentication
        process. User&rsquo;s credit-card/debit card details are transacted upon secure sites of approved payment
        gateways which are digitally under encryption, thereby providing the highest possible degree of care as per
        current technology. However, Prac360 provides you an option not to save your payment details. User is advised,
        however, that internet technology is not full proof safe and User should exercise discretion on using the same.
      </li>

        trends to help Prac360 improve its Service. The linkage between User&rsquo;s IP address and User&rsquo;s
        personally identifiable information is not shared with or disclosed to third parties. Notwithstanding the above,
        Prac360 may share and/or disclose some of the aggregate findings (not the specific data) in anonymized form
        (i.e., non-personally identifiable) with advertisers, sponsors, investors, strategic partners, and others in

        for information from the User to help Prac360 to customize the Website to deliver personalized information to

        necessarily reflect those of Prac360, and they are not authorized to bind Prac360 to any contract. Prac360
        hereby expressly disclaims any liability for any reliance or misuse of such information that is made available
        by Users or visitors in such a manner.</li>
      <li><strong>1.15</strong>Prac360 does not collect information about the visitors of the Website from other
        sources, such as public records or bodies, or private organisations, save and except for the purposes of

        any data loss or theft due to unauthorized access to the User&rsquo;s electronic devices through which the User
        avails the Services, Prac360 shall not be held liable for any loss whatsoever incurred by the User.</li>
      <li><strong>1.18</strong>Prac360 implements reasonable security practices and procedures and has a comprehensive
        documented information security programme and information security policies that contain managerial, technical,
        operational and physical security control measures that are commensurate with respect to the information being
        collected and the nature of Prac360&rsquo;s business.</li>
      <li><strong>1.19</strong>Prac360 takes your right to privacy very seriously and other than as specifically stated
        in this Privacy Policy, will only disclose your Personal Information in the event it is required to do so by
        law, rule, regulation, law enforcement agency, governmental official, legal authority or similar requirements or
        when Prac360, in its sole discretion, deems it necessary in order to protect its rights or the rights of others,
        to prevent harm to persons or property, to fight fraud and credit risk, or to enforce or apply the Terms of Use.
